                This current version allows you to record what books you own (my library) versus what you want to buy (wishlist) and what you just plan on reading (tbr).
                Future versions of this app will allow you to record what room your book is in, give books star ratings, add reviews, and other cool features. 
                If you have a feature to recommend pop over to the Contact page.
